# Pong-Game
ABOUT PROJECT : 

    ABOUT GAME : 

    Pong is a table tennis themed arcade sports video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. It was one
    of the earliest arcade video games. Pong was the first commercially successful video game, and it helped to 
    establish the video game industry.

    WHY I CHOSE THIS PROJECT :

    Reason why I chose this project was to learn how to build simple, yet Interactive and user friendly games 
    using JavaScript as it helps in building logic, solving complex looking functionality and much more. As I 
    have used p5.js library in this project so with the help of this project I also got to learn and work with 
    this small and simple JavaScript library. I have used class based approach in this project for different 
    components which makes our code look cleaner and sorted. 

    TECH STACK : 

    This is a pong game made with the help of p5.js library which is a JavaScript library having tonnes of drawing
    functionality that we can use to make developing 2D games nice and easy. This JavaScript library is for 
    creative coding.
    P5.js is a JavaScript implementation of the popular library called processing.
    Processing is an open source low level animation and GUI library built on java which was created to make it 
    easier to develop visually oriented applications with emphasis on animation and providing user instant feedback
    through interaction. So, in total this pong game is made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript as Tech Stack, with more
    emphasis on JavaScript.

    PROJECT DESCRIPTION : 

    This is a DUAL player mode of pong game which can be played by two individual. It has a welcome screen which 
    ask user to press ENTER to start the game and on start a 60 seconds timer will begin to clock, both player 
    has to move their respective paddle using their allotted keys (a & z keys for up and down movement of left 
    paddle while up-arrow & down-arrow keys for up and down movement of right paddle) and have to save the ball 
    from touching/passing their respective side back  wall by hitting the approaching ball with the help of paddle
    movement. If any player misses the ball to hit with their respective paddle (making paddle hit/pass their 
    respective back side wall) will lead to increment of 1 point in opponent score. And when timer points to 0 
    second the game will stop and whosoever has the highest score among player1 and player2 will be the winner and
    the winner name will be highlighted at the centre of canvas and on equal score "Match Tied" will be displayed 
    at centre.
